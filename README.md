## introduction

Creating the function rush taking two variables of type int as arguments, named respectively x and y. The function should display (on-screen) a rectangle of x characters for width, and y characters for length.

## compilation

Alterate the values passed to the rush function in the `main.c` file, for example:

```
rush(3, 5)
``` 

To compile you need to chose one of the `rush0...` files, example:

```shell
$ clang ft_putchar.c main.c rush00.c && ./a.out
```

The output would be:

```
o-o

```
